Explain the working of below pig script commands with an example:



*. LOAD - Loading data from the file system.

	eg: file1 = load '/input' using PigStorage(',') as (id:int, name:chararray, sal:int);



* STORE - Stores data into file system.

	eg: store file1 into '/user/file1';




* DUMP - Display the result to the screen.

	eg: dump file1;




* FOREACH - Iterates the tuples of a relation for generating a data transformation.

	eg: file2 = foreach file1 generate id;





* FILTER - Select  set of tuples from a relation based on a condition.

	eg: file3 = filter file1 by sal>2000;





* GROUP BY - Group data in one or more relations.

	eg: file4 = group file1 by id;





* ORDER BY - Sort a relation based on one or more fields.

	eg: file5 = order file1 by DESC;





* DESCRIBE - Returns the schema of an alias.

	eg: describe file1;
